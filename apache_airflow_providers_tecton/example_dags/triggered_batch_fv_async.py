            This example shows a use case where you have a BatchFeatureView with triggered materialization 
            where Tecton handles retries.
            
            Note that because the operator is async, we have to use TectonSensor to detect when the jobs are complete.
            
            In this scenario, we want to kick off a model training when the offline feature store is ready, as well as 
            report when the online feature store is up to date to our monitoring. We use example BashOperators in place 
            of actual training/reporting operators.
